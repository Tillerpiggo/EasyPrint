# Team Report

## Goals

**First week** - none

## Progress

- We’ve outlined the team roles and will begin to work towards our first milestone
- Played around with yeoman - the tool for creating a basic vs code extension
- Begun to research AI models and potential challenges regarding this
- Discussed and clarified potential functionality for the project
- Met everyone on the team!*

## Plans

First order of business is to create a very basic vscode extension that:

- Trivially modifies code (e.g. by adding `//` at the end of the line)
- Provides option to modify highlighted code via system dropdown menu

Further steps towards milestone 1:

- Design and plan the architecture for our application
- Design major user flows and visuals
- Sign up for the GPT 3.5 API and try to make our first call to it
- Create simple prompts that generate usable print statements

# Personal Reports

## Akash Prasad

### Goals

**First week** - none

### Progress

- Worked on first steps in developing the vs code extension - working with Yoeman to start this process
- Some difficulties setting up yeoman - could have future difficulties syncing up the git repo
- Perhaps may have to redo this process 

### Plans

- Develop a very basic vs code extension - by October 20th 
- Set up the Chat GPT 3.5 API - get the key for making a call - by next week
- Try to make first call into the API - by next week

## Tyler Gee

### Goals

**First week** - none

### Progress

- Played around with GPT-3.5, discovered strengths and limitations which helped to inform use cases
- Requires specific goal for meaningful output (i.e. track this variable, add print statements to show branch coverage, etc.)
- Weak at handling multiple instructions (we should keep goals focused in scope)
- Large variety in output (we can mitigate this by reducing temperature in the API)
- Conclusion - we need to reduce scope of usage and have simple instructions for each query
- Worked on first steps in developing the vs code extension

### Plans

- Design UI with basic use cases and flows - by end of weekend

## Tyler R

### Goals

Nothing to report. For last week’s tasks.

### Progress

This week I researched some of the Chat gpt API. I looked into the capabilities of vs code and how to create an extension. I also researched the capabilities of the generative AI and the abilities to get expected feedback from a generative AI model

### Plans

- Start designing the functions for some of our features.
- Start developing the high level concepts that will serve as the foundation for our extension.
- Start working on a rendering for the UI to develop the architecture of the system and how the user will interface with our system.

## Vidyaaranya Macha

### Goals

**First week** - None

### Progress
- Researched best practices for designing user-friendly code editing tools and extensions.
- Came up with high-level requirements for the tool from the point of view of the customer.
- Started looking at how to build vs code extension using yeoman for scaffolding the same.

### Plans
- Create a preliminary outline of the features and functionalities the interface will need to support.
- Collaborate with the backend developer to align the front-end design with the tool's functionality.
- Refine the list of features and user interactions based on feedback and evolving project requirements.
- Aim to start the implementation of the front-end interface as soon as the ideation stage is finalized.
