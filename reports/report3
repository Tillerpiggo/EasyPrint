# Team Report

## Goals
Add basic functionality to the current VS code extension - following the same structure:
- Trivially modifies code (e.g. by adding `//` at the end of the line)
- Provides the option to modify highlighted code via system dropdown menu

Further steps towards milestone 1:
- Sign up for the GPT 3.5 API and try to make our first call to it
- Create simple prompts that generate usable print statements

## Progress

- Created an API controller and can now send requests to GPT API
- Setup CI for automated testing and integration


## Plans
- Use API controller to do more complicated prompts
- Build a prompt generator to create complex promts to send to the AI API

# Personal Reports

## Tyler R
### Goals
- Start working on a rendering for the UI to develop the architecture of the system and how the user will interface with our system.
- Build a basic extension so that we can start developing the software and build upon a base functional program.
- Develop the classes and modules and start planning the backend functions for the features we plan to integrate.
- Start working on the API controller to make API calls to gpt 3.5

### Progress

- Created API controller and tests that I was able to send a request and generate a predictable response
- Configured testing evironment to work with our CI service.
- Started developing modular design for backend functions

### Plans

- Create AI prompt generator
- Integrate some front end features with the backend functionality
- finish design of backend functions and implement some of the functions


## Aishah

### Goals
- Implement highlighting feature as an addition to the VSCode extension. 
- To support the above goal, look into the VSCode API as well as other UI additions we can make to create a better user experience
- Look into how we can use the VSCode extension to modify code (as well as unmodify later)

### Progress
- Have a much better idea of limitations with the UI as well as the extension itself in terms of timeline. 
- Since the VSCode extension (super basic) is working now, we can move onto looking into editing code

### Plans

- Research editing/deleting code functionality using VSCode API
- Get highlighting feature to work as well as set up other keybindings
- Assist with backend functions (manual debugging/print statement functions)
