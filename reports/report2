# Team Report

## Goals
- Trivially modifies code (e.g. by adding `//` at the end of the line)
- Provides option to modify highlighted code via system dropdown menu

Further steps towards milestone 1:

- Design and plan the architecture for our application
- Design major user flows and visuals
- Sign up for the GPT 3.5 API and try to make our first call to it
- Create simple prompts that generate usable print statements


## Progress
As part of our milestone project, we have developed our architecture and have designed the user flows and visual representation of our
design. We have signed up for GPT 3.5 API and plan to make our first call very soon. We started to research how to create and build an 
extension and started playing around with the available tools. 

## Plans

- Build a basic version of the software that can modify or add very basic text like "//". 

# Individual Contributions

##Tyler R

###Goals

- Start designing the functions for some of our features.
- Start developing the high level concepts that will serve as the foundation for our extension.
- Start working on a rendering for the UI to develop the architecture of the system and how the user will interface with our system.

###Progress
This week I started to plan out some high level program details that can be coded into our extension once the coding starts. I did research more into the AI interfaces and set up an account to 
generate an API key that is necessary in order to integrate the AI APIs. I started making progress on the vs code APIs and started to develop a plan for calls to functions in vs code that may 
be useful or relevant to this project. 

###Plans
- Start working on a rendering for the UI to develop the architecture of the system and how the user will interface with our system.
- build a basic extension so that we can start developing the software and build upon a base functional program.
-develop the classes and modules and start planning the backend functions for the features we plan to integrate.
